            <h1>NAWED</h1>
            <h3>I Am a <span>Full Stack Developer</span></h3>
            <p>Dedicated and passionate student currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA). With a
                strong foundation in computer science and a keen interest in both front-end and back-end technologies, I am
                on a journey to become a proficient full-stack developer.

                Throughout the MCA program, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, including Java, Python,
                and JavaScript. I have developed a deep understanding of database management, software engineering
                principles, and web development frameworks such as React, Angular, Node.js, and Express.js.

                Driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, I have actively participated in coding competitions,
                hackathons, and collaborative projects, gaining hands-on experience in building and deploying full-stack
                applications. I am well-versed in working with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and
                have a solid grasp of version control systems like Git.

                In addition to my technical expertise, I possess strong analytical and communication skills, making
                me an effective team player in agile development environments. I am continuously learning and
                staying updated with the latest industry trends to ensure I am equipped with the most relevant and
                cutting-edge tools and technologies.

                With a passion for creating seamless user experiences and efficient, scalable systems, I am committed to a
                career as a full-stack developer, eager to contribute to innovative projects that make a real-world
                impact.</p>
